<!--
BTW this is my first time using HTML. I've nevermade my own HTML before (even though I am following guides, this is a big step).
Also, I've already made lots of dumb noob mistakes. That just goes to show how new to HTML I am.

<h1>HTML Error 404</h1>
<h2>That's an error that means that one of us made a mistake.</h2>
<h5>(probably me)</h5>
<br>
<p>Followed a bad link?</p>
<br>
<p>You should probably tell whoever made the link that it doesn't work. For your convienience, you can use this </p>
<button onclick="goBack()"nifty-button</button><script>function goBack() {window.history.go(-1);}</script>
<p>nifty-button</p>
<p>to go back where you came from!</p>
